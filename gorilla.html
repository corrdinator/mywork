                <h3>GORILLA</h3>
<p>Gorillas are the largest primates and are known for their intelligence, strength, and close genetic relation to humans. They live in family groups called troops, led by a dominant male known as a silverback.</p>
<p>Gorillas are mostly gentle and shy herbivores, feeding on fruits, leaves, and shoots. Despite their powerful build, they are peaceful and rarely aggressive unless threatened. Gorillas communicate through sounds, gestures, and even facial expressions.</p>
<p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM:</strong></p>
<p>Youâ€™ll find the gorillas in pen G04, close to the rainforest dome area.</p>
