                <h3>MONKEY</h3>
<p>Monkeys are intelligent and social primates found in various regions, including tropical forests, savannas, and mountainous areas. They are known for their agility, playful nature, and curiosity.</p>
<p>There are two major types: Old World monkeys (Africa and Asia) and New World monkeys (Central and South America). Many species use their tails for balance, and some—like spider monkeys—even use them to grasp branches.</p>
<p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM:</strong></p>
<p>Monkeys can be seen in pen M09, near the swinging bridge and tropical exhibit.</p>
