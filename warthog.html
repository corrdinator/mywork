                <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
<p>Warthogs are wild members of the pig family found in grasslands and savannas of Africa. They are recognizable by their tusks, flat snouts, and warty facial bumps used for defense.</p>
<p>Warthogs are surprisingly fast runners and often seen kneeling to graze. Despite their rough appearance, they are peaceful grazers and often share burrows with other animals.</p>
<p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM:</strong></p>
<p>Warthogs are kept in pen W17, close to the savanna trail path.</p>
