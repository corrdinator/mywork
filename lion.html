                <h3>LION</h3>
<p>Lions are powerful big cats known as the "king of the jungle." They are the only big cats that live in social groups called prides, which consist of related females, their cubs, and a few adult males.</p>
<p>Male lions are easily identified by their impressive manes, while both sexes are known for their strength and majestic roars that can be heard up to 8 kilometers away. Lions are carnivores and primarily hunt at night in the African savannas where they naturally live.</p>
<p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM:</strong></p>
<p>The lions are housed in pen L04, near the main entrance and the waterfall rock formation.</p>
