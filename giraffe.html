                <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
                <p>Giraffes are the tallest land animals on Earth. Their long necks help them reach leaves on high trees, and their unique pattern of spots makes each giraffe distinct. Giraffes are social animals, often seen in groups called towers.</p>
                <p>They have long tongues and prehensile lips to strip leaves from branches, and they sleep very littleâ€”only about 30 minutes to 2 hours a day!</p>
                <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM:</strong></p>
                <p>Giraffes are located in pen G12, near the observation tower.</p>
