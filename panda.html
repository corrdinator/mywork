                <h3>PANDA</h3>
<p>Giant pandas are beloved bears known for their black-and-white coloring and gentle personalities. Native to China, they mainly eat bamboo and can spend up to 12 hours a day feeding.</p>
<p>Though bears, pandas are solitary and quiet animals, with strong jaws and teeth for crushing bamboo. They are a global symbol of conservation due to their endangered status.</p>
<p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM:</strong></p>
<p>Pandas are in pen P05, near the Zen garden and bamboo grove.</p>
