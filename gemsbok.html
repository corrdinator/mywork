                <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
<p>The gemsbok is a large antelope native to arid regions of Southern Africa. Known for its striking appearance, it has long, straight horns and bold black-and-white facial markings. Both males and females have horns, which can grow up to 85 cm long!</p>
<p>Gemsboks are highly adapted to desert life, able to survive with little water and tolerate extreme heat. Their diet mainly consists of grasses and dry shrubs, and they are often seen grazing in small herds.</p>
<p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM:</strong></p>
<p>The gemsbok enclosure is at pen G09, near the desert habitat exhibit.</p>
