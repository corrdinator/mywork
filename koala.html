                <h3>KOALA</h3>
<p>Koalas are tree-dwelling marsupials native to Australia, easily recognized by their fluffy ears, large noses, and cuddly appearance. Though often called "koala bears," they are not bears at all.</p>
<p>They spend most of their time sleeping—up to 20 hours a day—due to their low-energy diet of eucalyptus leaves. Koalas are mostly solitary and live in eucalyptus forests, where they climb and leap from tree to tree using strong limbs and sharp claws.</p>
<p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM:</strong></p>
<p>The koalas are in pen K07, tucked away in the shaded eucalyptus grove near the picnic area.</p>
